# Meetings App

Simple Meteor app for the CS249 students in Spring 2015.
Uses three external packages:

* twbs:bootstrap
* jquery
* momentjs:moment

To Do (though I will not do it, because it is part of the team projects)
- make the "Add a Meeting" functionality available only for logged in users
- check if the entered date is in the future
- sort entries in the client side (right now they are only sorted on the server side,
you need to refresh the page to see the sorted entries)
- for logged-in users make it possible to edit or delete a meeting they have entered

The current app is live at: http://meetingsappcs249.meteor.com/.
